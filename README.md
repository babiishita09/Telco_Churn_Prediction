# Telco_Churn_Prediction

# This Machine Learning based web app is about predicting whether a customer will change telecommunications provider, something known as “churning”.

# Objective

Customer churn occurs when customers stop doing business with a company.As the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one, maintaining a healthy customer base is important for the success of any business.As customers have multiple options in the telecom industry, the churn rate is particularly high in this industry.Individualized customer retention is difficult because businesses usually have a lot of customers and cannot afford to spend much time on one. The costs would be too high and would outweigh the extra revenue.But if a company could predict in advance which customers are at risk of leaving, they could focus customer retention efforts by directing them solely toward such "high risk" customers.

The main objective of my project was to build a predictive model to generate a prioritized list of customers most vulnerable to churn.

# Problem Statement
## Business Problem Overview

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-20% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, <b> customer retention </b> has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

In this project, I have analysed customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, built predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identified the main indicators of churn.
